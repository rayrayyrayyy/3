# Write a method in python that will create two separate text files after reading the source text file named integers.txt that contains 20 integers. 
# The first output file will be named double.txt containing the square of all even integers found in integers.txt.
# The second file will be named triple.txt containing the cube of all odd numbers found in the integers.txt.
