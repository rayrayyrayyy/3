# Write a method in python that will create two separate text files after reading the source text file named integers.txt that contains 20 integers. 
# The first output file will be named double.txt containing the square of all even integers found in integers.txt.
# The second file will be named triple.txt containing the cube of all odd numbers found in the integers.txt.

# open files integers.txt, double.txt, and triple.txt

# ask user for numbers
# check if inputs are integers

# parse the inputs

# put the numbers to integers.txt

# read integers.txt by line

# if extracted number is even
    # extracted number will be squared
    # write squared number to double.txt

# else if the extracted number is odd
    # extracted number will be cubed
    # write cubed number to triple.txt

# end of program
